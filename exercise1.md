In Python linting can be done with Pylint. It analyses the code, finds errors and makes suggestions. In order to use it, Pylint must be installed and then it can be run on the command line or, for example, enabling it on Visual studio. Python has several test runners available, but the standard library used is Unittest. It's both a testing framework and a test runner. Tests must be placed into classes as assertion methods. As Python is an interpreted language, the build phase is more about test execution than compilation.
There seem to be many alternatives to Jenkins and Github Actions, for instance, GitLab CI, Atlassian Bamboo, CircleCI and Travis CI. They all have free versions and support different operation systems. GitLab CI and Travis CI have both on premise and cloud options, while Circleci and Bamboo are on premise, with some cloud options. In order to choose between self-hosted and cloud-based environments, one needs to know specific details of the project. For most cases, the cloud option is a good choice. It's easily scalable, reliable and flexible as one can adjust used resources as needed. The self-hosted option requires more maintenance and expertise, but at the same time, one has full control over the environment's computing options and configurations. Moreover, in some cases, it might be a more private and secure option.
